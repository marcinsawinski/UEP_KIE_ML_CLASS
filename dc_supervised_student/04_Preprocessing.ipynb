    "### Instructions\n",
    " - Create the steps for the pipeline by calling a simple imputer, a standard scaler, and a logistic regression model.\n",
    " - Create a pipeline object, and pass the steps variable.\n",
    " - Instantiate a grid search object to perform cross-validation using the pipeline and the parameters.\n",
